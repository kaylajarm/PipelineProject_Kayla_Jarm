This Python script calculates differential expression and uses bio python to retrieve the appropriate transcriptome index from NCBI. This code can handle biological data like GenBank files and FASTQ files. First things first, make sure you've got all the necessary tools installed. You'll need Kallisto for quantifying transcript abundance, and if you are use MacOS you can easily get it by using Homebrew in your terminal. However, other devices are still able to download Kallisto using their respective console. Once that's sorted, make sure your environment is set up with the right directories and files. The script assumes a specific folder structure and filenames, so tweak those if needed.
Alright, now let's discuss running the script. You can fire it up from your terminal or any Python environment you prefer. Just navigate to the directory containing the script and type “python wrapper.py”. Keep an eye on the progress messages the script spits out—it'll notify you of any errors or if downloads are occurring such as the GenBank files, extracting CDS features, and quantifying transcript abundance from those FASTQ files using Kallisto.
Once the script has run, check out the log file it generates (PipelineProject.log). This holds all the details about what was being during the process and gives you the lowdown on transcript abundance statistics. If any issues occur, check your setup, file paths, and dependencies. I ran into many issues directing my code from the appropriate file path and downloading the proper file format. Feel free to customize the script to suit your needs!
